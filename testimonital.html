            I approached Mario’s Pest Control because I had a real nasty problem with some demented mushrooms. They seemed almost demented and tried taking over my house! Mario’s Pest Control was the best! They helped me by eradicating those pesky creatures. Mario himself has an unusual strategy that involves a lot of jumping, but it really does work! One thing I loved about Mario’s Pest Control was his upbeat and positive attitude despite having to deal with demonic inanimate objects every day. I would recommend Mario’s Pest Control to anyone who needs a friendly pest control specialist!

            Oh my goodness! I highly recommend Mario’s Pest Control! This plumber turned pest control specialist really helped me get rid of some unwanted visitors in my house. I first chose Mario’s Pest Control because I had heard of how great the prices were. However, I was so pleased with his demeanor and willingness to help out our family, especially my daughter, Peach. He truly went above and beyond, even helping us lay a brick wall! That’s not even in his job description! I would highly recommend Mario's Pest Control to individuals just like me, who need help with an annoying pest problem and want it done honestly. Thanks Mario!
