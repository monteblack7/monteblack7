            <p>Super Mario Odyssey is a wild, ambitious game. It’s got secrets, dinosaurs, and the type of flawless jumping you’d expect from a new main Mario made by the design wizards at Nintendo. It’s less Super Mario 3D World, more Super Mario 64. And it lets you throw around Mario’s hat, which I promise is more exciting than it sounds. In fact, hat-throwing is the core mechanic of Super Mario Odyssey, which will be out on October 27 for the Switch. You can hurl your hat like a boomerang to break bricks or collect coins. You can swing your hat in a circle, damaging any Goombas or Koopa Troopas in your perimeter. You can throw it in different directions and even hold down your throw button to keep it hovering in the air for a few seconds so you can hop on it like a platform. It’s a fun, satisfying gimmick that takes some adjustment (thanks to motion controls!) but feels really good.

                You can also use your hat to take over people’s bodies. You can inhabit Bullet Bills and use them to ride across gaps. You can capture a Chain Chomp and send it flying to break a big rock hiding a critical path. You can take over Koopas, tanks, and yes, even dinosaurs, as Nintendo teased during a trailer this morning. This mechanic has replaced Mario’s traditional power-ups, which I imagine will keep the whole game feeling fresh. “We started the project by taking Super Mario’s theme of surprise and simply riffing on that to come up with things that were purely fun,” said director Kenta Motokura during a presentation to reporters yesterday. “The result of that was, the team just came up with a seemingly endless stream of fun prototypes. We wanted to use all of them, and so we thought sandbox spaces would be the best way to play all of those fun ideas.”

                That’s Super Mario Odyssey: a collection of sandboxes. The game is separated into a whole bunch of worlds (“kingdoms”), not unlike Super Mario 64 or Sunshine. Each of these worlds is full of Power Moons, which are Odyssey’s equivalent of Stars or Shines, although the developers say Power Moons are far more common. You’ll need to collect these Power Moons if you want to make progress to new worlds (via your hat-shaped spaceship, the Odyssey). You can find them anywhere, snagging them every time you do a mission or creep through a secret passage. “By coming up with lots of different fun ideas and placing them all over these fun sandboxes, we were able to come up with stages of very high density gameplay elements,” Motokura said. “You’ll want to check behind every suspicious wall, jump up every cliff, kill every boss you find. Almost everything that draws the player’s attention could potentially reward them with a Power Moon.” Collecting a Power Moon won’t take you out of the map the way it would in Mario 64 or Sunshine, Motokura added. “The game is designed so you can explore and play without interruption. And no matter which Power Moons you collect, you’ll still be able to advance the story.”

                Density is the watchword. Yesterday at Nintendo’s E3 booth in the LA Convention Center, I got a chance to play around 30 minutes of Super Mario Odyssey. I hopped around the Manhattan-esque grids of New Donk City, climbing skyscrapers and digging through the sewers for secret treasure. (After a bit of exploring, I even found Captain Toad standing on a girder. Good old Captain Toad.) Then I strolled through a large desert area, taking over Bullet Bills and hunting for Power Moons amongst sandy dunes and towers. What’s clear, even just from 30 minutes, is that Super Mario Odyssey is packed full of secrets. They’re not lying when they say it’s dense. In New Donk City, for example, the winding streets and alleys are packed full of things to discover and smack with your hat. You can climb to the top of buildings and try to jump between the skyscrapers, crawl into the sewers and find a hidden maze, or find a rocketship that’ll take you to a platforming challenge. This is a Mario game that appears, from the short time I spent with it, to be more about exploration than progression.
